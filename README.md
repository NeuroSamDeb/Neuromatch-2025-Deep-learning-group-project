## Overview
The following short project is based around the analysis of transfer learning and it's dependance on model complexity, dataset similarity and computation time. 
The analysis is introductory in scope, with an attached summary and presentation.

## Models
- AlexNet pretrained on ImageNet
- ShuffleNet pretrained on ImageNet
- ResNet-50

## Datasets
- CIFAR-10/100
- MNIST
- GTZAN

## Key findings
- Limited cross domain generalization for differing datasets as tested on AlexNet using MNIST, CIFAR-10 and GTZAN
- Model complexity does not significantly affect transfer learning in image classification tasks as tested using ShuffleNet vs ResNet-50 and AlexNet

## Contribution
This project was completed as part of a colloborative neuromatch program. My contribution included literature review
and preparation of the final presentation slides.
