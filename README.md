## Overview
The following short project is based around the analysis of neuronal recordings collected in the stringer dataset 
with respect to a number of spontaneous activities in mice. The analysis is introductory in scope,
with an attached summary and presentation.

## Methods
- PCA
- UMAP (Exploratory)
- GLM (Normal and L2 penalty)
- Feedforward Neural network

## Key findings
- Linear models (GLM) performed better than nonlinear models (Feedforward neural networks)
- PCA reduced predictive performance in the GLM for running speed

## Contribution
This project was completed as part of a colloborative neuromatch program. My contribution included literature review
and preparation of the final presentation slides.
